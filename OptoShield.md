# Detailed Hardware Description

The OptoShield is an open hardware product, you are free to make your own device. If you come up with improvements, please let us know so we can improve our design as well. The discussion below should help you to improvise one on a breadboard or even manufacture one by a professional PCB making service. 

## Circuit design


## Parts

To make an OptoShield either on a PCB or on a breadboard you will need the following parts or their similar equivalents:

| Name             | Part | pcs.  | Value | Note |
|------------------|------|-------|------|------|
| Bright white LED |      |       |      |      |
| Potentiometer    |      |1      | 10k  |      |
| Photoresistor    |      |2      | 10k  |      |
| Resistor         |      |2      | 10k  |      |


## PCB
The printed circuit board has been designed in the Freeware version of the [DIPTrace](https://diptrace.com/) CAD software. The PCB is two-layer and fits within the customary 100 x 100 mm limit of most board manufacturers. The DIPTrace PCB layout can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/wiki/file/OptoShield_PCB.zip), while the ready-to-manufacture Gerber files with the NC drilling instructions are available from [here](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/wiki/file/OptoShield_Gerber.zip).
