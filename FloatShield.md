# Introduction

FloatShield is a didactic tool based on the Arduino platform. This project has been created as a part of the [AutomationShield](https://www.automationshield.com) project and is aimed at teaching and learning control engineering concepts.

The FloatShield consits of a translucent vertical tunnel containing a ball that is floating inside via an air current generated by a fan. The goal is to control the position of the ball within this column by the means of a feedback controller.

The basic design of FloatShield consists of a potentiometer, a distance sensor, a reference item and a computer fan attached to our own-design PCB. A transparent tube and a distance sensor is mounted by 3D printed parts.
The function principle is based on controlling the distance of the reference item using the PID feedback controller. Manual control is operated by power regulation of the fan through a potentiometer, which is scaled to a pulse width modulated signal (PWM).

# Hardware insight 

The Float Shield is an open-source hardware product, dedicated to be widely spread among a control engineering community. Feel free to use any part of it for your own experiments. If you come up with improvements, please let us know so we can improve our design as well. A documentation posted below might help you while working on improvised experimental prototype on breadboard or perforated board.

## PCB layout

The printed circuit board has been designed in the Freeware version of the [DIPTrace](https://diptrace.com/) CAD software. The PCB is two-layer and fits within the customary 100 x 100 mm limit of most board manufacturers. The DIPTrace PCB layout can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/wiki/file/OptoShield_PCB.zip), while the ready-to-manufacture Gerber files with the NC drilling instructions are available from [here](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/wiki/file/OptoShield_Gerber.zip).
