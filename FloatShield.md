# <a name="intro"/>Introduction
The FloatShield belongs to the family of control engineering education devices for Arduino that form a part of the [AutomationShield](https://www.automationshield.com) project. The basic design of FloatShield consists of a transparent vertical tube containing a ball that is floating inside inside due to an air current generated by a fan attached to our own-design PCB. The tube and the distance sensor are mounted by 3D printed parts. The goal is to control the position of the ball within this column measured by a distance sensor, which creates a simple single-input single-output (SISO) feedback loop. The user may also regulate power of the fan manually—using a potentiometer, the output of which is then scaled to a pulse width modulated signal (PWM).

For a better visualization the entire assembly was 3D-modeled (see the illustration below) using the CAD software CATIA V5R20 (Student Edition) and can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/files/1942312/assembly.zip). Note that there are three parts to be 3D printed—a tube clamp, a tube lid and a sensor holder. One may also use a honeycomb tube insert to make the turbulent air flow relatively laminar. Feel free to download the ready-to-print [parts](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/files/1977698/parts.zip). The remaining, purchased assembly parts—the [fan](https://grabcad.com/library/fan-40-x-40-x-28-1) and [Arduino Uno](https://grabcad.com/library/arduino-uno-r3-4)—are downloadable from the GrabCAD database.

# <a name="api"/>Application programming interface

## <a name="io"/>C/C++ API
The basic application programming interface (API) serving the device is written in C/C++ and is integrated into the open-source [AutomationShield Arduino library](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield). This library contains hardware drivers and sample exercises for control systems engineering education. All functionality associated with the FloatShield is included in the `FloatShield.h` header, which contains the `FloatClass` class that is constructed by default as the `FloatShield` object. The functions specific to this shield mostly perform input/output peripheral communication.

The summary of basic functions and the illustration below should get you started quickly:
* Output (sensor): `FloatShield.sensorRead();` 
* Input  (actuator): `FloatShield.actuatorWrite();`

![float_actsens](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18485913/71261097-c8acd000-233c-11ea-999e-1d3d7fe034d1.png)

The following subsections describe the methods used to access the input and output of the FloatShield. Note that before you begin an experiment you must initialize the hardware by calling

`FloatShield.begin();`

which launches the I2C interface and starting the time of flight (TOF) sensor itself.

Although the sensor provides distance readings directly in millimeters, the outputs should be scaled to the range of 0–
100% in order to use the Serial Plotter functionality, where all outputs are scaled to the same axis. The calibration
procedure is called by

`FloatShield.calibrate();`

finding the minimal and maximal distance readings and map these values to percentages. Later on, one may check
whether the calibration procedure was invoked or not by the `wasCalibrated()` method and access the minimal
and maximal distance of the ball from the sensor by executing `returnMinDistance()` and `returnMaxDistance()`.

### Input
The position of the ball is read by

`y=FloatShield.sensorRead();`

returning the scaled distance inside the tube as a floating point value from within the range of 0–100 (%). Alternatively, `sensorReadDistance()` reports the distance between the sensor and the ball in millimeters, while `sensorReadAltitude()` gives its altitude relative to ground.

### Output
By supplying the input power `u` in the range of 0–100 (%) to the

`FloatShield.actuatorWrite(u);`

method, the user can set the power sent to the fan through the power circuitry. This method checks for constraints to
avoid overflow, maps the input to 8-bit PWM integers, then sends it to the D3 pin of the Arduino.

Finally, user reference from the potentiometer is acquired by calling

`r=FloatShield.referenceRead();`

returning the position of the potentiometer runner as a floating point scaled to 0–100 (%).

# <a name="hardware"/>Detailed hardware description
The FloatShield is an open hardware product, you are free to make your own device. If you come up with improvements, please let us know so we can improve our design as well. The discussion below should help you to improvise a similar setup for experimentation on a breadboard or perforation board. You may even order a professionally made PCB by a PCB fabrication service.

## <a name="circuit"/>Circuit design
The circuit schematics has been designed in the Freeware version of the [DIPTrace](https://diptrace.com/) CAD software. You may download the circuit schematics of the FloatShield from [here](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/files/1934584/Float_scheme.zip).

The fan and the TOF sensor are only represented by their connectors, while we assume that 12 V external power is drawn through the VIN pin of the Arduino (a).

The fan is powered by an N-channel MOSFET **C1** (l), and driven by the D3 PWM capable microcontroller pin through an 1 kΩ current limiting resistor **R1** (m). Floating states are handled by a 10 kΩ pull-down resistor **R2** (n), while a diode **D1** (o) ensures back electromotive-force (EMF) protection. A connector (p) finally leads to the fan terminals. Since the fan requires 12 V and more current than the USB-powered Arduino can handle, a separate wall adapter power supply is required to operate the device.

The TOF sensor is integrated to a convenient open-source breakout board, thus it can be effortlessly connected (q) to the I2C bus of the Arduino (SDA,SCL).

Finally, the potentiometer **POT1** (r) runner is attached to the A0 ADC capable pin of the board.

## <a name="pcb"/>PCB
The printed circuit board has been designed in the Freeware version of the [DIPTrace](https://diptrace.com/) CAD software. The PCB is two-layer and fits within the customary 100 x 100 mm limit of most board manufacturers. The DIPTrace PCB layout can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/files/1916198/FloatShield_PCB.zip), while the ready-to-manufacture Gerber files with the NC drilling instructions are available from [here](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/files/1916200/FloatShield_Gerber.zip).

The assembled shield is fixed mechanically and electrically to the Arduino board through stackable header pins. The location of the components is also illustrated in the PCB layout below. The axial fan is mounted to the board on standoffs and a hole cut at the manufacturing stage of the PCB increases the air intake capacity.
