### Introduction

FloatShield is a didactic tool based on Arduino platform. This project has been created by  students of control engineering as a part of AutomationShield projects and is aimed at students of control engineering.
The basic design of FloatShield consists of a potentiometer, a distance sensor, a reference item and a computer fan attached to our own-design PCB. A transparent tube and a distance sensor is mounted by 3D printed parts.
The function principle is based on controlling the distance of the reference item using the PID feedback controller. Manual control is operated by power regulation of the fan through a potentiometer, which is scaled to a pulse width modulated signal (PWM).
