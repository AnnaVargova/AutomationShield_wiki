## PCB
The printed circuit board has been designed in the Freeware version of the [DIPTrace](https://diptrace.com/) CAD software. The PCB is two-layer and fits within the customary 100 x 100 mm limit of most board manufacturers. The DIPTrace PCB layout can be downloaded here, while the ready-to-manufacture Gerber files with the NC drilling instructions are available from here.
